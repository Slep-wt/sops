## Airspace

AYNZ ADC is responsible for the Class C Airspace within the AYNZ CTR `SFC` to `A020`.

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **GUNKI**, **LOTGU**, **NUPTA**, **ODOGA**, **RUVKI**, **STARF**, **TOMOM** or **UNSAM** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

All other aircraft may be assigned either a VOR or visual departure.

### VOR and GNSS Departures

Due to high terrain around AYNZ, VOR/GNSS departures are utilised in IMC to allow aircraft to depart safely. GNSS can be utilised in lieu of a VOR radial.

!!! example
  `ANG100 Turn right Heading 130 to intercept the NZ 115 radial, Runway 09, Cleared for Takeoff`

!!! example
  `ANG95 Turn left direct to BEMGO, Runway 27, Cleared for Takeoff`

As there is high terrain to the north of AYNZ, do not instruct aircraft to turn left on departure when utilising Runway 09.

| NZ VOR Radial | Waypoint |
| ----|----|
| 115  |LARID|
| 226 |VIDOT|
| 268  |MUDIX|
| 285  |BEMGO|

## ATIS
### Approach Expectation

If visual approaches are in operation the APCH field must state `EXP VISUAL APCH`.

## Coordination
### AYNZ TCU
#### Auto Release

'Next' coordination is **not** required from AYNZ ADC for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Tracking via one of the following VOR/GNSS departures:

| NZ VOR Radial | To Waypoint |
| ----|----|
| 115  |LARID|
| 268  |MUDIX|
| 285  |BEMGO|

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to AYNZ TCU.

The standard assignable level from AYNZ ADC to AYNZ TCU is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`.
